# kguardian

**Kubernetes Security Made Simple** - Automatically generate least-privilege Network Policies and Seccomp Profiles using eBPF-powered runtime behavior analysis.

## What is kguardian?

kguardian is a **Kubernetes security toolkit** that observes your applications at runtime using eBPF technology and automatically generates tailored security resources. Say goodbye to manual policy crafting and hello to zero-trust security that adapts to your workloads.

## Why kguardian?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Save Hours of Manual Work">
    Writing Network Policies and Seccomp profiles by hand is tedious and error-prone. kguardian observes your running applications and generates policies automatically in seconds.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="lock" title="Implement Zero-Trust Security">
    Start with a default-deny posture and allow only the exact network paths and syscalls your applications actually use. No guesswork, no over-permissioning.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="eye" title="Gain Runtime Visibility">
    See exactly how your pods communicate and what system calls they make. The built-in UI provides real-time insights into your cluster's behavior.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Integrate with GitOps">
    Export policies as YAML files for review and version control. Perfect for Infrastructure as Code workflows and compliance audits.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How it Works

kguardian consists of four components working together:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Controller Monitors">
    The **Controller** (Rust + eBPF) runs as a DaemonSet on your nodes, using kernel-level eBPF programs to capture network traffic and syscall activity with minimal overhead.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Broker Stores">
    The **Broker** (Rust + Actix-web) receives telemetry from controllers and stores it in PostgreSQL, providing a historical view of your workload behavior.
  </Step>

  <Step title="CLI Generates">
    The **CLI** (`kubectl kguardian`) queries the broker, analyzes traffic patterns, and generates ready-to-apply Network Policies and Seccomp profiles.
  </Step>

  <Step title="UI Visualizes">
    The **UI** (React + TypeScript) provides an interactive graph showing pod communication, making it easy to understand complex network topologies.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quick Example

Generate a Network Policy for a pod in seconds:

```bash
# Install the controller (one-time setup)
helm install kguardian oci://ghcr.io/kguardian-dev/charts/kguardian \
  --namespace kguardian \
  --create-namespace

# Let your app run normally for a few minutes...

# Generate policy from observed traffic
kubectl kguardian gen networkpolicy my-app -n production \
  --output-dir ./policies

# Review and apply
kubectl apply -f ./policies/production-my-app-networkpolicy.yaml
```

<Check>
**That's it!** You now have a least-privilege network policy based on real runtime behavior.
</Check>
