## What is Seccomp?

Seccomp (Secure Computing Mode) is a Linux kernel feature that restricts which **system calls** (syscalls) a process can make.

### Why Limit Syscalls?

Most applications use only 50-100 of Linux's 300+ syscalls. Blocking unused syscalls:
- Reduces attack surface
- Prevents privilege escalation exploits
- Stops malicious code from using dangerous syscalls

## How kguardian Generates Profiles

1. **Observes** all syscalls made by the container via eBPF
2. **Aggregates** unique syscall names over observation period
3. **Generates** JSON profile with allowlist

Example generated profile:

```json
{
  "defaultAction": "SCMP_ACT_ERRNO",
  "architectures": ["SCMP_ARCH_X86_64"],
  "syscalls": [
    {
      "names": ["read", "write", "open", "close", "socket", "connect"],
      "action": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Actions

- `SCMP_ACT_ALLOW`: Allow the syscall
- `SCMP_ACT_ERRNO`: Block with error (default for unlisted)
- `SCMP_ACT_LOG`: Log the syscall but allow it
- `SCMP_ACT_KILL`: Kill the process (most restrictive)
